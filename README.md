# Aviation Accidents Dataset


## Project Title: 
# Risk Analysis of Aircraft Types for Safer Business Operations






### 1. Introduction

In this project we will be working with Aviation Accident Dataset to solve our business problem.

The purpose of this project is to analyse data and determine which aircraft types are at the lowest risk of accidents. Using the  Aviation dataset, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to find out the partterns in accidents by aircraft type, weather conditions and the most affected countries. 






#### Business Problem

The business problem is, the company is interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. So we need to analyse the data and find out which  aircraft Make is suitable.   

#### Objectives
1. Cleaning the dataset for accurate for analysis.

2. Analyzing the dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis in order to identify patterns, trends and the risk factors associated with different make of aircraft.

3. Creating visualizations and interpreting our findings using our dataset to assist the company in identifying the safest aircraft for its new business endeavor. 
  


### 2. Data Understanding

Load the dataset




### 3. Data Cleaning and Analysis
 This involves tasks like removing duplicates, filling in missing values, fixing errors, and standardizing formats.




##### handling missing data
 Removing the  rows and columns with excessive missing values.
 The threshold for the columns will be 50%




### 4. Data Visualization

Using Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), we will visualize the data to enhance our understanding of the data analysis and to achieve our objective. 




##### Analyze how aviation accidents have trended over the years.

Interpretation:
there gradual decrease over the Years.
1982 had the highest number of accidents
The darker the colour the higher the number of accidents

#####  Accidents by Country
![Image B](Images/B.png)


Interpretation:
The United States has significantly high number of accidents compared to the rest of the countries

#####  Weather Conditions and Accidents
Examine the relationship between weather conditions and accident severity.

Interpretation:
vmc means  fly by visual, on clear weather
From the bar plot above most crashes occur on clear weather(vmc) meaning that weather is not a significat factor affecting accident occurence.

##### Accident counts by aircraft Make
 Compare accident counts by aircraft make

Interpretation:
 The number of accidents in cessna is significatly higher than the other aeroplane makes  

The following are the conclusions

### 5. Findings

The following are the findings from the above plots
1. The number of accidents in cessna is significatly higher than the other aircraft makes.

2. There gradual decrease of accidents over the Years. 1982 had the highest number of accidents The darker the colour the higher the number of accidents.

3. The United States has significantly high number of accidents compared to the rest of the countries.

4. vmc simply means fly by visual, on clear weather. Most crashes occur on clear weather(vmc) meaning that weather is not a significat factor affecting accident occurence.



### 6. Recommendations

1.Avoid high-risk aircraft like Cessna and opt for safer alternatives such as Aviocar CASA which has significantly fewer number of accidents.

2.The company can start its business in regions with lower accident frequencies like Germany, avoiding U.S. hotspots. 

3.Adopt predictive maintenance practices and modernize the fleet with safer and newer aircraft models, to minimize risks and ensure aircraft reliability.
